Be sure to call ahead before going in person so that the practitioner can protect themselves and other patients too. Some general guidelines you can follow provided that you or someone you know is infected are: 1. Stay home/practice social distancing. People who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to recover at home. 2. Separate yourself from other people in your home. 3. You should wear a facemask when you are around other people. 4. Cover your coughs and sneezes: 5. Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. 6. Avoid sharing personal household items. 7. Clean and disinfect all high-touch surfaces everyday.",
